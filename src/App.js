        <SectionHeading>A little about me:</SectionHeading>
        <p>I have a strong background in website development with a focus on marketing-driven B2B corporate websites. In my current role I manage a team of developers to work alongside marketing teams from just-funded (and maybe a bit overwhelmed) startups to CMOs of mature publicly traded companies to build, manage and maintain their web presence.</p>

        <p>I am adept at both the creative and technical aspects, enabling me to quickly conceptualize and execute solutions. I am adaptable and keen on learning to expand my skill sets and stay updated with evolving web technologies, allowing me to be comfortable researching and adopting new tools, methods, frameworks and tech stacks.</p>

        <p>I’m looking for a website to build and own with a marketing team or to work alongside a team of developers. My current role involves quickly relaunching sites and sending them off to clients, I feel my expertise could shine on fewer and more focused projects to utilize the culmination of my experience and implemented features. I can comfortably work alongside back-end, other front-end developers, designers and marketers.</p>

        <h2 className="text-3xl uppercase mb-8">A note on my Portfolio:</h2>
        <p>For the last eight years I have been operating under <strong>Non Disclosure Agreements</strong> which limits my work examples, however the caliber of sites and clients I currently work with can be found at <a href="https://atre.net/clients" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">atre.net/clients</a>. As VP of Engineering I am still very hands-on with projects and had a heavy hand in many of our client sites. I was also utilized for any architecture concerns, complex front end builds and high visibility projects. On top of the B2B corporate sites, I’ve also had a hand in internal and private applications.</p>

        <p>This résumé itself can be viewed as an example via the source code on github <a href="https://github.com/adam-sch/2024/tree/main/src" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>. This app utilizes some straightforward core React examples, Tailwind, and a simple deploy-from-git. Of course there are many more elements and levels of detail that would go into a real production site that I am experienced with but outside the scope of this application. Please also note that the majority of my git contributions are outside of GitHub on private repositories like Pantheon.</p>
